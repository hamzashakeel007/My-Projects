Audio Aura of a user can be measured/calculated by first figuring out the genre of the songs the user often listens to and rates to
then based on his top certain frequent songs we can combine those genres and based on the genres combined, an emotion(s) can be
linked to that specific combination of genre and can be presented in visuals to the user.
